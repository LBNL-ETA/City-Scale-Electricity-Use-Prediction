# Overview
We developed data-driven models to predict city-scale electricity consumption.
- We developed and compared four models: (1) five parameter change-point model, (2) Heating/Cooling Degree Hour model, (3) time series decomposed model implemented by Facebook Prophet, (4) Gradient Boosting Machine implemented by Microsoft lightGBM, and (5) three widely-used machine learning models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network).
- We applied our models to explore how extreme weather events (e.g., heat waves) and unexpected public health events (e.g. COVID-19 pandemic) influenced each cityâ€™s electricity demand

# Code Usage
### Clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/City-Scale-Electricity-Use-Prediction
cd City-Scale-Electricity-Use-Prediction
```

### Set up the environment 
Set up the virtual environment with your preferred environment/package manager.

The instruction here is based on **conda**. ([Install conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/))
```
conda create --name cityEleEnv python=3.8 -c conda-forge -f requirements.txt
conda activate cityEleEnv
```

### Repository structure
``bin``: Runnable programs, including Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks

``data``: Raw data, including city-level electricity consumption and weather data

``docs``: Manuscript submitted version

``results``: Cleaned-up data, generated figures and tables


### Running
You can replicate our experiments, generate figures and tables used in the manuscript using the Jupyter notebooks saved in ``bin``: `section3.1 EDA.ipynb`, `section3.2 linear model.ipynb`, `section3.3 time-series model.ipynb`, `section3.4 tabular data model.ipynb`, `section4.1 model comparison.ipynb`, `section4.2 heat wave.ipynb`, `section4.3 convid.ipynb`
